# FoodExpress

The aim of the project is to develop a system which facilitates the user travelling by train to get information about the 
availability of a particular food item on the nearby station. The user has to enter the details like name of the train, bogie 
number, food item needed and then the app will provide the rated shops with their  distances from that bogie wherever
that food item is available on the coming  station.After 15 minutes of getting details about a shop, user will get a notification 
to provide feedback about that shop and this feedback will improve the user  experience
